Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?



DriverPass is wants to help increase students passing their driving test to obtain a license. They want to create software that will allow students and secreataries to schedule and make appointments for the class. 
The students can choose from a varitey of packages that suits their needs. If they cannot scheudle the class themseleves, they will need to have the secretary do so. 
One thing I feel I did well was understand the problem and what solution DriverPass wanted. Where I could have imporved is taking the time to think a bit deeper about everyone involved in this project.
This would include the internal employess, IT, and the client and how would this system help everybody. I could have thought about the smaller details involved more in depth. 
The way I interpreted what the user needed was by reading the script over outloud to make sure that I understood what was being asked in order to create the software. Verify that you understand the request will allow you to
determine if this software is even already on the market because if so, how is the new software going to be different that what already exist. On top of that, you don't want to start
developing software wthat might not be feasible if there was a huge cost or not a ROI. You wouldnt want to get halfway through the project and there is no more funding for the project either. 
What I liked most was using the activiy design because this method demonstrated the logic about the software and which parts of the software interefered with each other and which parts did not. I have never experienced
the planning portion being in my field so it was interesting to experience all the steps that are involved before even coding a single thing. Moving forward having a plan and articulating it through design will save me so much more time.
